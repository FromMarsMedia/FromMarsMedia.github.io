        <p>One of the most recognizable figures in contemporary music, Beyoncé rose to fame as the central member of pop-R&B
          group Destiny's Child before embarking on a multi-platinum, record-breaking solo career in 2001. Booming record
          sales, Grammy awards, movie roles, and marriage to rapper/CEO Jay-Z combined to heighten her profile in the 2000s.
          Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA acknowledged that, through 64 gold and platinum
          certifications, she was the decade's top-selling artist. Once she released her fifth solo album in 2013, it was
          evident that the singer, songwriter, and dancer wasn't merely an entertainer but a progressive artist as well.
        </p>

        <p>Born in Houston in September 1981, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles began performing at age seven, winning over 30 local competitions
          for her dancing and vocal abilities. She joined her cousin Kelly Rowland and classmates LaTavia Roberson and LeToya
          Luckett in forming an adolescent vocal group. Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé's father and Rowland's legal guardian, signed
          on to be the girls' manager, eventually quitting his full-time job to focus on their efforts. This situation would
          ultimately lead to the creation of one of the most popular female R&B groups of all time: Destiny's Child.</p>

        <p>Destiny's Child gained momentum throughout the '90s. They appeared on Star Search in 1992 (under the name Girls Tyme)
          and weathered several lineup changes before signing to Columbia in 1997. Four studio albums later, the group had
          officially become the best-selling female group of all time, with such smash hits as "Jumpin' Jumpin'," "Bills,
          Bills, Bills," "Say My Name," and "Survivor" bolstering the young women's momentum despite lawsuits from former
          members Roberson and Luckett. In 2001, Beyoncé, Rowland, and replacement member Michelle Williams allowed themselves
          a break from the group to pursue individual solo careers. Before landing several movie roles, Beyoncé became the
          first African-American female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award.
          An appearance in the MTV drama Carmen: A Hip Hopera quickly followed, but it was her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in
          2002's Austin Powers in Goldmember that established her as a true Hollywood star. </p>
